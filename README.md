Alternative Specification for the FLIF Image Format (Incomplete)
================================================================

The original specification is available over [here][flif-orig].

Please read this specification over [here][spec].

This document is being written due to the incompleteness and lack of
comprehensiveness of the original specification. This document hopes to cover
whatever that is lacking in the original specification, enough so that a
working encoder and decoder can be implemented without examining the available
reference implementation.
